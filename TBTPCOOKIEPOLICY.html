       <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p> 
       <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your  mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 

        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, tbtbpsa.com) are called "first party cookies".

      <p><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></p> <p>
        We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for 
        technical reasons in order for our app to operate, and we refer to these as
